## Next up

- Don't normalize profile/mesh to unit size. Instead, set camera scale.
- Add button to create/view tetrahedral version of mesh (not quite working)
- Add Triangular/Tetrahedral mesh toggle
- Pass the cached TetMesh to the mesh2faust method to transform it to Faust code
- Display the Faust code in the text editor and update the dsp
- Make the text editor non-editable (read-only)
- Use Ben's axisymmetric solver (via file IO)
  - Add a toggle between the tet mesh vs axisymmetric audio model
- Add material controls for audio model
- Implement UI for the generated Faust code
- Mouse wheel camera zoom
